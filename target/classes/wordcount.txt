In a very short time, Apache Spark has emerged as the next generation big data proâ€�
cessing engine, and is being applied throughout the industry faster than ever. Spark
improves over Hadoop MapReduce, which helped ignite the big data revolution, in
several key dimensions: it is much faster, much easier to use due to its rich APIs, and
it goes far beyond batch applications to support a variety of workloads, including
interactive queries, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.
I have been privileged to be closely involved with the development of Spark all the
way from the drawing board to what has become the most active big data open
source project today, and one of the most active Apache projects! As such, Iâ€™m particâ€�
ularly delighted to see Matei Zaharia, the creator of Spark, teaming up with other
longtime Spark developers Patrick Wendell, Andy Konwinski, and Holden Karau to
write this book.
With Sparks rapid rise in popularity, a major concern has been lack of good reference 
material. This book goes a long way to address this concern, with 11 chapters
and dozens of detailed examples designed for data scientists, students, and developers
looking to learn Spark. It is written to be approachable by readers with no backâ€�
ground in big data, making it a great place to start learning about the field in general.
I hope that many years from now, you and other readers will fondly remember this as
the book that introduced you to this exciting new field.
As parallel data analysis has grown common, practitioners in many fields have sought
easier tools for this task. Apache Spark has quickly emerged as one of the most popuâ€�
lar, extending and generalizing MapReduce. Spark offers three main benefits. First, it
is easy to useâ€”you can develop applications on your laptop, using a high-level API
that lets you focus on the content of your computation. Second, Spark is fast, enaâ€�
bling interactive use and complex algorithms. And third, Spark is a general engine,
letting you combine multiple types of computations (e.g., SQL queries, text processâ€�
ing, and machine learning) that might previously have required different engines.
These features make Spark an excellent starting point to learn about Big Data in
general.
This introductory book is meant to get you up and running with Spark quickly.
Youâ€™ll learn how to download and run Spark on your laptop and use it interactively
to learn the API. Once there, weâ€™ll cover the details of available operations and disâ€�
tributed execution. Finally, youâ€™ll get a tour of the higher-level libraries built into
Spark, including libraries for machine learning, stream processing, and SQL. We
hope that this book gives you the tools to quickly tackle data analysis problems,
whether you do so on one machine or hundreds.
